# Schema Objects

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and describe the schema objects available within MariaDB Enterprise Server
- Demonstrate how to create and use databases, tables, and columns in MariaDB Enterprise Server
- Compare and contrast the data types and built-in functions in MariaDB Enterprise Server, and explain their use cases

### Collations and Character Sets

- A collation is a set of rules that defines how to compare and sort strings

- A character set defines how and which characters are stored to support a particular language or languages

- Only applicable to text fields such as `VARCHAR` or `TEXT`

- The default character set is `latin1` and the default collation is `latin1_swedish_ci`

- Collation and character set are specified at table or column level

### Listing Character Sets

```shell
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW CHARACTER SET;

| Charset | Description                 | Default collation | Maxlen |
|---------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| big5    | Big5 Traditional Chinese    | big5_chinese_ci   | 2      |
| dec8    | DEC West European           | dec8_swedish_ci   | 1      |

## Databases, Tables and Default Schemas

### Case Sensitivity

Depends on operating system, file system and `lower_case_table_names` configuration

Set before starting a project (strongly recommended!)

Usually case sensitive by default on Linux, but not on Windows and MacOS

Adopt a convention such as always creating and referring to databases and tables using lowercase names

Most identifiers (database, table, and column names) are limited to 64 characters

### Databases

**Database aka Schema**

Highest level object

Corresponds to a directory within the data directory

All other objects reside within user-created databases however certain objects such as user accounts, roles, stored procedures and plugins reside within system databases.

```sql
-- create new database with name 'world'
CREATE DATABASE `world`;

-- list of exists databases
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### Tables

- Stores rows of structured data organized by typed columns

- Each corresponds to a metadata file (`.frm`) and data file(s), dependent on the storage engine  
  *(i.e. InnoDB tablespaces)*

- Qualified by a database name  
  *(i.e. database.table)*

### Columns

Set of typed data values

Qualified by a table name  
(i.e. table.column)

Stored together in each row (MariaDB Server) within pages, within tablespaces or data files

Generated columns are stored if they are created as `PERSISTENT` | `STORED` though `VIRTUAL` columns are not stored

Index

### Indexes

- Exact copy of selected columns followed by primary key (e.g., name, address, ID)
  - For long columns the index might not be an "exact copy", but instead it might contain a prefix of the column
- Fast lookup of data within a table without having to scan all columns for each row
- For InnoDB the primary key is silently appended to the end of secondary indexes, unless specified elsewhere within an index
- Attribute of a table

### Constraints

- Types: Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, and Check
- Support and implementation differs per storage engine
- Allows data within column(s) to be limited or constrained to a set of values
- Usually defined with a corresponding index
- Attribute of a table
- Has potential for contention at scale

### AUTO_INCREMENT

- Use `LAST_INSERT_ID()` to obtain the value generated for the client connection
- `SERIAL` is a synonym for `BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE`
- In Aria the counter can be set back manually if the counter value wraps
- InnoDB prepares `AUTO_INCREMENT` counters when MariaDB Server starts
  - Single mutex on a table, behavior changed with `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traditional** | **Consecutive** | **Interleaved** |
| Default | | |
| Holds table-level lock for all `INSERT`s until end of statement | Holds table-level lock for all bulk `INSERT`s (such as `LOAD DATA` or `INSERT ... SELECT`) until end of statement | No table-level locks are held ever |
| | For simple `INSERT`s, no table-level lock held | Fastest and most scalable |
| | | Not safe for statement-based replication |
| | | Generated IDs are not always consecutive |

### Column Attributes

Columns have strict type definitions

Can specify a `DEFAULT` value for a column

Only one column per table can be declared `AUTO_INCREMENT`; it must be indexed (commonly the `PRIMARY KEY`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'unknown'
);
```

Columns can be NULL, unless defined NOT NULL
- NULL means "No Value", "Not Applicable", or "Unknown"
- Use NULL when value is not an empty string
- NOT NULL
  - Reduces storage in some storage engines
  - Can also reduce execution time because there are more CPU cycles used to first check for NULL

### Views

- Virtual table defined by a SQL `SELECT` query
- Evaluated at each access
  - No materialized views
- Treated as a table for many purposes, shares namespace with tables
- Updateable in certain cases (`WITH CHECK OPTION`)
- Qualified by a database (`database.view`)

### Using Views

Customers Table

```shell
| ID | FirstName | LastName |
|----|-----------|----------|
| 1  | Alice     | Evans    |
| 2  | Bob       | Smith    |
```

Addresses Table

```shell
| CustomerID | Address1          | City    |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1          | 123 Main Street   | Anytown |
| 2          | 456 Spruce Street | Anyburg |
```

Create CustomerAddresses View as select from Customers and Addresses tables:

```sql
CREATE VIEW CustomerAddresses AS
SELECT
    CONCAT(c.FirstName, ' ', c.LastName) as FullName,
    CONCAT(a.Address1, ', ', a.City) as FullAddress
FROM Customers c
JOIN Addresses a ON c.id = a.CustomerId;
```

Fetch data from CustomerAddresses View

```sql
SELECT FullName, FullAddress FROM CustomerAddresses;
```
```shell
| FullName    | FullAddress               |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Alice Evans | 123 Main Street, Anytown  |
| Bob Smith   | 456 Spruce Street, Anyburg|
```

### Stored Routines

- Types: Functions, Triggers, Events, and Stored Procedures
- Has input and output parameters
- Reusable SQL Code
  - SQL/PSM (default)
  - SQL/PL which is a compatible subset of PL/SQL (`sql_mode=ORACLE`)
- Can allow cursor loops
- Runtime script, not compiled or binary
- Lack of good debugging, can be hard to profile
- Can be bad for statement based binary logging
- Stored routine uses the privileges of the user that defined it (user can be changed with the `DEFINER` clause)
- If `SQL SECURITY INVOKER` is set then the privileges of the user executing the stored routine are used
- Qualified by database (`database.my_stored_procedure`)

### Creating Your First Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE city (
    ID INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name CHAR(35) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    CountryCode CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    District CHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    Population INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    PRIMARY KEY (ID),
    KEY CountryCode (CountryCode),
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (CountryCode)
        REFERENCES country (Code)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

- Name and type of object being created
- Column definitions
- Define primary key, secondary indexes and constraints
- Define engine, partitions, character set and other attributes

### Altering Tables

`ALTER TABLE` IS USED TO CHANGE A TABLE'S SCHEMA

**ADD COLUMN** to add a column

**DROP COLUMN** to drop a column *(deletes data!)*

**CHANGE COLUMN** and **MODIFY COLUMN** to alter a column

```sql
ALTER TABLE table1
ADD COLUMN col5 CHAR(8),
DROP COLUMN col3,
CHANGE COLUMN col4 col6 DATE,  # new column name col6
MODIFY COLUMN col8 VARCHAR(10);
```

Basic syntax example for `ALTER TABLE` statement

### Temporal Tables

```sql
| Type                   | Tracks                          | Sample Use Cases                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| System-Versioned       | Change history                  | Audit, forensics, IoT temperature tracking |
| Application-Time Period| Time-limited values             | Sales offers, subscriptions              |
| Bitemporal             | Time-limited values with history| Schedules, decision support models       |
```

*mariadb-dump* does not read historical rows from versioned tables, and so historical data will not be backed up.

#### System-Versioned Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    amount INT
) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING;
```

#### Application-Time Period Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE coupons (
    id INT UNSIGNED,
    date_start DATE,
    date_end DATE,
    PERIOD FOR valid_period(date_start, date_end)
);
```

#### Bitemporal Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE coupons_new (
    id INT UNSIGNED,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    date_start DATE,
    date_end DATE,
    PERIOD FOR valid_period(date_start, date_end)
) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING;
```

### Default Schemas

#### information_schema
- The encyclopedia of your database
- Contains information on databases, tables, columns, procedures, indexes, statistics, partitions and views
- Plugins can install additional information_schema tables
- Thread pool information tables
- Keyword and SQL functions

#### mysql
Stores information on:
- Server configuration
- Grants and timezones
- User accounts
- Roles
- Stored procedure definitions
- Stored function definitions
- Event definitions
- Plugins installed by `INSTALL SONAME`/`INSTALL PLUGIN`

#### performance_schema
- Metrics and performance data
- Covered in detail in our Performance Tuning class

### Default Schemas

#### `sys_schema`

- Added in MariaDB 10.6
- Tracks configuration changes in `sys_config` table
- Has views, functions, and stored procedures for getting detailed metrics

### Information Schema Details

- Pseudo database that holds metadata on schemas
- Generated as needed
- No on-disk presence
- Read-only tables
- Plugins can install additional information schema tables (e.g. `METADATA_LOCK_INFO`)
- Useful for schema design, redesign and migration
- Provides much more information than `SHOW` statements and is ANSI/ISO SQL:2003
- Do NOT automate queries in production as this can affect performance
  
```sql
  CHARACTER_SETS  
  COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APP  
  LICABILITY  
  COLLATIONS  
  COLUMN_PRIVILEGES  
  COLUMNS  
  ENGINES  
  EVENTS  
  FILES  
  GLOBAL_STATUS  
  GLOBAL_VARIABLES  
  KEY_COLUMN_USAGE

  STATISTICS  
  TABLE_CONSTRAINTS  
  TABLE_PRIVILEGES  
  TABLES  
  TRIGGERS  
  USER_PRIVILEGES  
  VIEWS  
```

### Methods of Accessing the Information Schema

**Accessing Directly (Using SELECT from relevant tables)**

```sql
SELECT
    TABLE_SCHEMA,
    ENGINE,
    COUNT(*)
FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA NOT IN('mysql','information_schema','performance_schema')
GROUP BY TABLE_SCHEMA, ENGINE;

SELECT *
FROM information_schema.global_status
WHERE VARIABLE_NAME LIKE '%qcache%';
```

**Using Show Statements**

```sql
SHOW STATUS LIKE '%qcache%';
```

### Crash Safe System Tables

#### mysql Schema

`SELECT ENGINE, TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.tables WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA="mysql";`

- Most system tables will show an ENGINE of ARIA
- However some system tables will show an ENGINE as CSV
  - `slow_log`
  - `general_log`
- Some INNODB related tables will remain INNODB tables
  - `mysql.gtid_slave_pos`
  - `mysql.innodb_index_stats`
  - `mysql.innodb_table_stats`
  - `mysql.transaction_registry`

## Data Types

MariaDB supports a wide variety of data types to efficiently store and manage different kinds of information. Choosing the most appropriate data type for each column is essential for ensuring data integrity, optimizing storage, and improving query performance. The main categories of data types in MariaDB are:

- **Numeric**: For storing numbers, including integers and floating-point values.
- **String**: For storing text and character data.
- **Binary**: For storing raw binary data such as files or images.
- **Temporal**: For storing dates, times, and timestamps.
- **JSON**: For storing and querying structured JSON documents, enabling flexible and semi-structured data storage.
- **VECTOR**: For storing fixed-length arrays of numeric values, supporting use cases such as AI embeddings and similarity search.
- **User-Defined**: For custom types such as ENUM, SET, or spatial types.

When defining columns, always select the data type that best matches the range and nature of the values you need to store. Using an inappropriate type can lead to wasted space, loss of precision, or unexpected behavior.

MariaDB's behavior when handling out-of-range or invalid values is influenced by the `sql_mode` system variable. In the default mode, MariaDB may silently truncate or round values that do not fit the column's data type. However, enabling strict SQL modes (such as `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`) will cause errors to be thrown instead, helping to enforce data integrity.

For example, the `INT` type is commonly used for integer values:

```shell
MariaDB [(none)]> help INT;
Name: 'INT'
Description: INT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]

A normal-size integer. 
The signed range is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
The unsigned range is 0 to 4,294,967,295.
```

Refer to the documentation for each data type to understand its storage requirements, valid ranges, and behavior under different SQL modes.

### Numeric Data Types

MariaDB provides several types for storing numerical data. All numeric types support the `UNSIGNED` attribute, which allows you to store only non-negative values and thus increases the upper limit for each type. By default, signed types reserve one bit for the sign, so using `UNSIGNED` enables a larger positive range within the same storage size.

#### Integer Types

- **TINYINT** – 1 byte, range: -128 to 127 (signed), 0 to 255 (unsigned)
- **SMALLINT** – 2 bytes, range: -32,768 to 32,767 (signed), 0 to 65,535 (unsigned)
- **MEDIUMINT** – 3 bytes, range: -8,388,608 to 8,388,607 (signed), 0 to 16,777,215 (unsigned)
- **INT**, **INTEGER** – 4 bytes, range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (signed), 0 to 4,294,967,295 (unsigned)
- **BIGINT** – 8 bytes, range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (signed), 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (unsigned)

**Notes:**
- Use `UNSIGNED` when negative values are not needed.
- `INT(n)` specifies display width, not storage size or precision.
- Actual storage and precision may vary by storage engine.
- Out-of-range values are handled according to `sql_mode`:
  - **Default:** Values are truncated silently.
  - **Strict:** Errors are generated.
- `TINYINT(1)` is commonly used for Boolean values and is aliased by the `BOOLEAN` type.
- `BIGINT` provides a very large range and should be used only when necessary.

#### Floating Point and Fixed-Point Types

- **FLOAT** – 4 bytes, approximate value, single precision
- **DOUBLE** – 8 bytes, approximate value, double precision
- **DECIMAL(m, d)** – exact value, user-defined precision (up to 65 digits), stores numbers as strings for accuracy
- **NUMERIC** – synonym for `DECIMAL`
- **REAL** – synonym for `DOUBLE` (unless `REAL_AS_FLOAT` SQL mode is enabled)

**Notes:**
- `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` are approximate types and may introduce rounding errors.
- `DECIMAL` is an exact type, suitable for storing monetary or other precise values.
- `DECIMAL(m, d)` specifies the maximum total number of digits (`m`) and the number of digits after the decimal point (`d`).
- Use `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC` for financial data or where exact precision is required.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE numbers_example (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    small_num TINYINT,
    big_num BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    ratio FLOAT,
    measurement DOUBLE
);
```

### String data types

MariaDB provides several string data types to store character data efficiently. These types are used for everything from single-character codes to large-scale text documents, and they are defined by their maximum length, character set, and collation.

- **CHAR(n)** - Number of characters, not bytes, wide
  - Always stores n characters
  - Automatically pads with spaces for shorter strings
- **VARCHAR(n)** - Variable length up to maximum n characters
  - Changes to `CHAR` in Implicit Temporary Tables and mysqld internal buffers
  - 256 characters and longer treated as `TEXT`
  - For InnoDB, this maximum will depend on the row format
- **TEXT** - Large text object
  - Up to 65,535 (2^16 - 1) characters
  - Not supported by the `MEMORY` Storage Engine
  - MariaDB uses `ARIA` for implicit on-disk temporary tables
- **TINYTEXT** - Text type limited up to 255 (2^8 - 1) characters
- **MEDIUMTEXT** - Text type limited up to 16,777,215 (2^24 - 1) characters
- **LONGTEXT** - Text type limited up to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1) characters

#### String data attributes

String columns are defined by a **Character Set** and a **Collation**. These can be inherited from the server or database, or set specifically at the table or column level.

- **Character Sets**: Determine how characters are encoded. Modern MariaDB (10.6+) defaults to `utf8mb4` for full Unicode support. Multi-byte sets provide broader character support but increase disk storage and memory requirements.
- **Collations**: A set of rules for comparing and sorting strings. Modern MariaDB uses UCA (Unicode Collation Algorithm) based collations, such as `utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci`, which offer improved linguistic accuracy and can be overridden within specific queries.

Table and column character set and collation may be defined at table creation. The example below shows a couple of variants:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (
    -- columns with charset latin1 and default collation
    latin_name text CHARSET latin1,
    -- column with default charset and utf8mb4_general_ci collation
    utf8mb4_name text COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci,
    -- column with certain charset and collation
    utf8mb3_name text CHARSET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci  
);
```

How to inspect Character Set and Collation? One of methods - call `CREATE TABLE <table name>;` command.
```shell
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Table | Create Table                                                                          |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| t     | CREATE TABLE `t` (                                                                    |
|       |   `latin_name` text CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci DEFAULT NULL,      |
|       |   `utf8mb4_name` text CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci DEFAULT NULL,  |
|       |   `utf8mb3_name` text CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci DEFAULT NULL   |
|       | ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci                 |
```

### Binary Data Types

Binary data types in MariaDB are used to store raw binary data, such as files, images, or any data that does not represent text. Unlike character types, binary types do not interpret or encode the data—they simply store bytes as-is. The main binary data types are:

- **BINARY(n)**: Fixed-length binary string. Always stores exactly `n` bytes, padding with `0x00` if the input is shorter.
- **VARBINARY(n)**: Variable-length binary string, up to `n` bytes. Only uses as much space as needed for the data.
- **TINYBLOB**, **BLOB**, **MEDIUMBLOB**, **LONGBLOB**: Used for storing large amounts of binary data. The main difference between these types is the maximum amount of data they can store:
  - `TINYBLOB`: Up to 255 bytes
  - `BLOB`: Up to 65,535 bytes (64 KB)
  - `MEDIUMBLOB`: Up to 16,777,215 bytes (16 MB)
  - `LONGBLOB`: Up to 4,294,967,295 bytes (4 GB)

**Key points:**
- Binary columns use the `binary` character set and collation, which means no character encoding or collation rules are applied.
- BLOB types are often used for storing files or large binary objects, but storing large files in the database can impact performance and memory usage.
- Binary data is included in transactions, replication, and backups.
- Unlike text types, binary types are compared byte-by-byte, not by character value.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    filename VARCHAR(255),
    data LONGBLOB
);
```


- `BINARY`, `VARBINARY` and `BLOBs` can contain data with bytes from the whole range from 0 - 255
- Uses a special character set and collation called "binary"
- Blobs are often used to store files in a database
  - Files on disk are often faster
  - But referential integrity is not guaranteed
- Blobs are included in transactions, replication, and backups
- Blobs inflate `mysqld` memory usage
- Modern InnoDB has some improvements in storage and lookup of blobs

### Temporal Data Types

- **DATE**  
  - Stores dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, with a range from `'0000-00-00'` to `'9999-12-31'`.
- **TIME** [(<microsecond precision>)]  
  - Stores time values in the format `hh:mm:ss` (optionally with fractional seconds).
  - Range: `-838:59:59.000000` to `838:59:59.000000`.
  - Microsecond precision can be specified from 0 to 6 (default is 0).
- **DATETIME** [(<microsecond precision>)]  
  - Stores date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (optionally with fractional seconds).
  - Range: `'0000-00-00 00:00:00'` to `'9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999'`.
  - Microsecond precision can be specified from 0 to 6 (default is 0).
- **TIMESTAMP**  
  - Stores date and time as the number of seconds since `'1970-01-01 00:00:00'` UTC (Unix timestamp).
- **YEAR**  
  - Stores a year value as a 4-digit number, with a range from `1901` to `2155`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
    birthday DATE,
    stage_from YEAR,
    working_hours_from TIME,
    working_hours_to TIME,
    updated_at DATETIME(6),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### JSON Data Type

- JSON is a language-independent data format.
- JSON documents can be validated for correct syntax with `JSON_VALID()` used as a `CHECK` constraint.
- MariaDB supports a full set of JSON functions.
- JSON columns can be indexed by values of an attribute.
- The indexes are created by using virtual generated columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE city (
    name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
    info JSON DEFAULT NULL
);

INSERT INTO city VALUES (

### Special Data Types

- **ENUM** is an enumerated list of string values
  - Holds one of the values listed
  - Stored as 2-byte integer index, presented as value

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE country (
      continent ENUM('Asia','Europe','N America','Africa','Oceania','Antarctica','S America')
  );
  ```

- **SET** is a specified list of string values
  - Can hold one or more values from the defined set

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE country_languages (
      country_code CHAR(3),
      language SET ('English','French','Mandarin','Spanish')
  );

  INSERT INTO country_languages VALUES
      ('CHN','Mandarin'),
      ('CAN','English,French');
  ```

- **INET6** is a data type for storing IPv6 IP addresses as well as IPv4
  - Stores as a BINARY(16)
  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE ip_address (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
      address INET6
  );
  ```

- **VECTOR(N)** - data type enables MariaDB Server to store and query fixed-length arrays of numeric values, supporting use cases such as AI embeddings and similarity search.  
  - `N` specifies the number of dimensions (elements) in the vector, with a maximum of 16,383.  
  - The dimension count (`N`) should match the output size of your embedding algorithm.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE vectors (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
      v VECTOR(5) NOT NULL,
      VECTOR INDEX (v)
  );
  ```
